# Mars Rover take-home

## Getting started

Prerequisites: `node` and `yarn`

`$ cd` into folder and then run
`$ yarn` to install packages

`$ yarn build` to build project, at which point you may run
`$ yarn start` which will take the input from input.txt and output the result in your terminal

If you wish to test different inputs, you may edit input.txt, there's no need to rebuild after modifying this file.

## If I'd had more time I would

- allow input from terminal
- handle multiple grids in one input
- improve types, particularly in parsing
